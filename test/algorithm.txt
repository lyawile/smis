Within the same form through which a customer details are added,
pick a room from the option box that is populated from the available rooms in the database i.e system should not display rooms that are already occupied
click register button to give customer a room and store all details i.e his particulars, room.

Things you should care about:
If a room was taken, you may add a column named taken which stores either 1 or 0, if 1 a room is held by a customer else it is available for a new customer.
If a room was taken, you should read a range of dates in order to free it if time expires.

STEPS: 
add a new option box in the form at order.php file
<p>Rooms</p>
<select>
<option>Room 1 Floor: first</option> <!-- This data should be read from the database -->
</select>
Write a query to read the rooms available, it should read from the ordertb and rooms table as shown:
select `roomNumber`,floor from room r, ordertb o 
where r.id != o.`roomId`; 
execute the query.
To view the rooms available you should loop the variable containing the function mysqli_fetch_array() // read this function from w3schools.com.
Display the rooms using that loop in option box you added above.
It continues after you finish above part first.
